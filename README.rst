Installation & requirements |anaconda| |pypi| |github|
------------------------------------------------------

The easiest way to install the latest stable version of `empymod` is via
`conda`:

.. code:: bash

    conda install -c prisae empymod

or via `pip`:

.. code:: bash

   pip install empymod

Alternatively, you can download the latest version from GitHub and either add
the path to `empymod` to your python-path variable, or install it in your
python distribution via:

.. code:: bash

   python setup.py install

Required are python version 3.4 or higher and the modules `NumPy` and `SciPy`.
If you want to run parts of the kernel in parallel, the module `numexpr` is
required additionally.

**Note**: Do not use `scipy == 0.19.0`. It has a memory leak in `quad`, see
`github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/7216 <https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/7216>`_.
So if you use QUAD (or potentially QWE) in any of your transforms you might see
your memory usage going through the roof.

If you are new to Python I recommend using a Python distribution, which will
ensure that all dependencies are met, specifically properly compiled versions
of `NumPy` and `SciPy`; I recommend using Anaconda (version 3.x;
`continuum.io/downloads <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_).  If you
install Anaconda you can simply start the *Anaconda Navigator*, add the channel
`prisae` and `empymod` will appear in the package list and can be installed
with a click.
