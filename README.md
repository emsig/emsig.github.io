# Website of emg3d

The website of emg3d is generated by sphinx.

You can build it locally with
```
make html
```
where you can install the required dependencies with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The website can be deployed from the local machine with
```
make deploy
```

A GitHub Action is set up which will do that for each commit.

The website is served to https://emsig.xyz.
